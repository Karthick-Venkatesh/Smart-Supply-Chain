# Smart-Supply-Chain
Big Data Analysis of a supply chain dataset and suggestions to improve the management.
In this project I have tried to analyse the trends of the dataco supply chain dataset, like the most selling product and the days which hit them and also fraud and late delivery analysis. I have also tried using popular algorithms like RFM and ABC and made analysis with that. This is was done by referring other projects, I don't claim this to be my own.
